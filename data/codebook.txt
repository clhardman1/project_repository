The data was collated from a range of Wikipedia webpages on the history of fixtures between each country and the other nine.

It was directly downloadable as a .csv file to be read into RStudio. 
The columns includede in the dataset are:
### Date - date of the match in yyyy/mm/dd. 
### home_team - home team country

## Description of Dataframes and Variables 

### data1 - the raw, unedited dataframe imported as a .csv file.
### data - a dataframe constructed from:
      removing fixtures before 1995/08/26, values of 'TRUE' for world_cup, 'TRUE' for neutral, 
      columns competition, neutral and world_cup,
      adding columns home_win and away_win with values of 'Yes' if true and 'No' if false
### home_win_counts - a dataframe with a column named home_team that contains all ten countries and a column of home_wins where the values represent the amount of 'Yes' from the home_win column in the dataframe data.
                    - this became a new dataframe when the dataframe away_win_counts away_wins column was added to the home_win_counts one. 
### away_win_counts - a dataframe with a column named away_team that contains all ten countries and a column of away_wins where the values represent the amount of 'Yes' from the away_win column in the dataframe data. 
### final_data - the home_win_counts column renamed once the away_win_counts away_wins column had been added to it. 
### final_data_long - the dataframe used for the visualisations. a reshaped final_data dataframe, from a wide to long format so it is more suitable for producing the visualisation. 
### p - the first visualisation

### label_colours - contains the colour codes for each x axis category (each country).
### specific_date - a variable created to allow the removal of any fixtures before 1995/08/26. 

## Missing Values

Missing values in the raw dataframe were assigned an 'NA'. For this analysis, there were no missing values and no further action was needed.
