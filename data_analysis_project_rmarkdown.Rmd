## Project Introduction

For my PSY6422 project, I chose a dataset based on a personal interest of mine - Rugby Union. After exploring several open dataset websites, I came across the one I will be analysing on Kaggle (*International Rugby Union results from 1871-2023*). The information about fixtures and results was obtained by the author from Wikipedia. 
The research question that I formulated from this dataset is "(**Do the Top 10 Rugby Union Nations Win More Games Against the Other Nations at home or away?**). The Top 10 Nations (according to this dataset and World Rugby - 'https://www.world.rugby/rankings') are **South Africa, Ireland, New Zealand, France, England, Scotland, Argentina, Wales, Australia** and **Italy**.
